                <h4>Madeleine Doi ~ Core Team Leader</h4>
                <p class="text-grey"> I'm a currently senior at Holy Names Academy. I was first introduced to computer science in 8th grade when
                    participated in a Computer Science Camp. Through the camp I discovered how to print my name
                    to the terminal window. I also uncovered various solutions to improve my life through computer science such as developing
                    and implementing my own calculators and algorithms. I quickly grew my interest in and passion for computer science.
                    Volunteering at WATT enables me to inspire other young women to explore computer science.</p><br>
