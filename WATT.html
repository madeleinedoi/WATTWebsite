    <p class="text-grey">
        WATT is a non-profit organization founded in 2015 by two Holy Names graduates as a way to introduce girls to computer science at a young age.
        We are dedicated to bringing computer science to middle school aged girls throughout the Greater Seattle Area. Our organization is run by a core
        team of juniors and seniors.</p>

            <h4>Madeleine Doi ~ Core Team Leader</h4>
            <p class="text-grey"> I'm a currently senior at Holy Names Academy. I was first introduced to computer science in 8th grade when
                participated in a Computer Science Camp. Through the camp I discovered how to print my name
                to the terminal window. I also uncovered various solutions to improve my life through computer science such as developing
                and implementing my own calculators and algorithms. I quickly grew my interest in and passion for computer science.
                Volunteering at WATT enables me to inspire other young women to explore computer science.</p><br>
