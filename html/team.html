    <p class="text-grey" align="center">
        WATT is a non-profit organization founded in 2015 by two Holy Names graduates as a way to introduce girls to computer science at a young age.
        We are dedicated to bringing computer science to middle school aged girls throughout the Greater Seattle Area. Our organization is run by a core
        team of juniors and seniors.</p>

        <br>Their inspiration for starting WATT is rooted in the mentorship that they received as young women, and the belief that continuing the cycle of mentorship is an opportunity to grow
        personally and to uplift the computer science field for women.</p><br>

        <h4>Madeleine Doi ~ Core Team Leader</h4>
        <p class="text-grey"> I'm a currently senior at Holy Names Academy. I was first introduced to computer science in 8th grade when
            participated in a Computer Science Camp. Through the camp I discovered how to print my name
            to the terminal window. I also uncovered various solutions to improve my life through computer science such as developing
            and implementing my own calculators and algorithms. I quickly grew my interest in and passion for computer science.
            Volunteering at WATT enables me to inspire other young women to explore computer science.</p><br>

        <p class="text-grey">I was first introduced to computer science in the 10th grade when I had the opportunity to take AP computer
            science! I had such a fun time in this class and decided to continue my computer science career by involving myself with Projects in
            CS the following year. Being able to combine two of my interests of working with young kids and learning/teaching computer science is such an amazing
            opportunity and I canâ€™t wait to teach young women about computer science through WATT this year!</p><br>

        <p class="text-grey">I am a senior at Holy Names Academy and have been interested in different aspects of technology for multiple years. I did a coding camp in 8th grade at HNA, which was what first drew me to the multifaceted field. As a junior, I took my first Computer Science
            class and fell in love with how CS develops a number of unique abilities and different thinking skills that are indefinitely useful. I am excited to be a part of WATT to use Computer Science to empower a new generation of girls!</p><br>
